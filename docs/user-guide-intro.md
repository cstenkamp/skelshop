# User guide introduction

This user guide is written bottom-up, with later sections detailing
conveniences, in particular the usage of [Snakemake](snakemake.md), that it is
likely you will want to make use of in most cases. For this reason it is
recommended to at least skim the all parts of the guide before proceeding with
using SkelShop.
